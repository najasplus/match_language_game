# Match language game
A word-matching game in python3 using pySimpleGui for graphics interface.
Provide the vocabulary with an input_dict.tsv, tab-delimited text file, where the first two columns correspond to word-translation pairs (order doesn't matter).

Start the game with

``` {bash}
python3 memo_game.py
```
